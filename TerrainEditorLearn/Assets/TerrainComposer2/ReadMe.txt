TerrainComposer 2 ReadMe
-------------------------------------------------------

The TerrainComposer 2 window can be opened in:
'Unity Menu -> Window -> Power Of Nature Software -> TerrainComposer2'.

*** TerrainComposer2 does not work on the Mac yet as Metal is required for this. 
Unity is working on adding Metal in the Mac Editor on Unity5.6. For more info and
supported platforms for Compute shaders visit the documentation page.

Visit the documentation page to find downloadable stamps, examples, documentation, video tutorials and release notes:
http://www.terraincomposer.com/terraincomposer2-documentation/

You can go to this page from within the TerrainComposer window by right clicking 
on the empty area (the area around the height/splat/color... buttons). And a popup
menu will appear and select 'Help -> Documentation'.

There's an example Scene included in the Examples/Scene folder. The animated folder contains animated 
terrain examples to show the seeding possibilities and the GPU speed. If you get a low framerate 
heightmap resolution should be set to 256. The animating can be stopped by disabling the animating scripts on the layers
(green nodes) in the 'Height' output. There are also project examples that can be loaded with TC Menu -> File -> Open. 

There's a high resolution stamp link on the documentation page. I didn't include this in the main package because I
want to keep the package size small, so it's easy to update on the Asset Store and fast to import.

Please read at least how the TC2 GUI works so you will be able to drag&drop, duplicate
 nodes and add layers and layer groups.

TerrainComposer1 is included as well and you can download it here:

I hope you will enjoy TerrainComposer2!
